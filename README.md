# Slot Machine 

This is a command-line-based slot machine game written in Python. The game allows players to place bets, spin the slot machine, and potentially win based on the symbols displayed.

## How to Play 

1. Deposit Money:
The player starts by depositing an amount of money to play with.

2. Choose Number of Lines:
The player chooses how many lines (1-3) they want to bet on.

3. Place a Bet:
The player places a bet on each line. The total bet is calculated by multiplying the bet amount by the number of lines chosen.

4. Spin the Slot Machine:
After placing the bet, the slot machine spins and displays symbols across the lines.
The player wins money if certain symbols line up on the lines they've bet on.

5. Winning Conditions:
The player wins if the same symbols appear across a line. The amount won is calculated based on the symbols and the bet placed.

6. Quit or Continue:
After each spin, the player can either continue playing with their current balance or quit the game.


## Features
